Hackathon Website:

In a hackathon you can follow two paths:  
* Hack and run the slide  
* Make a bullshit slide and hack a bit on the side

I am a developer, so I will always prefer finishing with a working proof of concept.
But if you have the will to continue the project, you need to think about its viability -
and so work on your slides, not for the hackathon jury but for the sake of your project ;)

Find here some reminders. They are basics that any project should provide beyond a fun POC.

Try to make a real code POC, but maybe have a look at the safety checks below ;)

This hackathon is a bit less about selling, since you already have client problematics to solve.
But for training, keep in mind the viability and feasibility, then prove it with a small one-day prototype to illustrate it.

### Reminder outside of the code:

* [ ] Do you have a CCC (if game)? [🤔](https://github.com/EloiStree/2022_04_20_PitchGuideHackathon/tree/main/VideoGame/CCC)
* [ ] Do you have your 4 pillars? [🤔](https://github.com/EloiStree/2022_04_20_PitchGuideHackathon/tree/main/VideoGame/FourPillars)
* [ ] What ‘pain’, or users need, are you solving? (No pain, no gain)
* [ ] Can you pitch your project? [📖 ->](https://github.com/EloiStree/2022_04_20_PitchGuideHackathon/blob/main/PocketCoachBeAbleToPitch.pdf) [📝](https://github.com/EloiStree/2022_04_20_PitchGuideHackathon/blob/main/PocketCoachFillTheGapPitch.pdf)
* [ ] If you plan to sell it: (For Fun, For Money, Life-Time) 
  * [ ] Can you explain your company’s viability (BMC)? [🖼️](https://github.com/EloiStree/2022_04_20_PitchGuideHackathon/blob/main/BMC.png)
  * [ ] Do you understand your user (value canvas)? [🖼️](https://github.com/EloiStree/2022_04_20_PitchGuideHackathon/blob/main/VALUE_CANVAS.png)
* [ ] If you plan to continue after the hackathon: _(Yes/No/BloodyMonday)_ 
  * [ ] What would you need to make it happen ?
  * [ ] What is blocking you from making it real ?
* [ ] If you have a unique opportunity when you exit the train: _(Are you ready ?)_
  * [ ] How would you present your project: _(Can you do it ?)_
    * [ ] In four words
    * [ ] In a breathable sentence
    * [ ] With a “Do you know how/who … to solve …”
* [ ] If the person has 5 minutes around a coffee: _(Would you be ready ?)_ 
  * [ ] Do you have 4 slides to illustrate your project ? _(Must be on your phone)_
  * [ ] Do you have a short 1-minute video to help understand the project? _(Must be on your phone or/and Youtube)_

* [ ] If the person loves your idea and wants you to explain it to the team in two days: *(Are documents ready for that?)* [📖 ->](https://github.com/EloiStree/2022_04_20_PitchGuideHackathon/blob/main/PocketCoachBeAbleToPitch.pdf)
  * [ ] Do you have a 7-minute slide deck to present the viability of your minimal viable version?
  * [ ] Check the “Ready to be Invested” items. [✅🪙->](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gs_6G_CeJOPihLF09ywC1yAFu7nMh4r602sboStd5zs/edit#gid=1911286289)
    * [ ] Pain: Are you sure you are coding for someone?
    * [ ] Solution: Are you sure the code will be used by the user?
    * [ ] Unique Specification: Are you sure the user won't use another service?
    * [ ] Market Understanding: Are you sure the user will be able to buy your service?
    * [ ] Target Segmentation: Are you sure you know who you are coding for?

    * [ ] Business Model: Are you sure the code will pay the salary of 4 employees for 10 years?
    * [ ] Profit and Loss on a beer coaster: Could you explain the math on a 10 cm beer coaster why your code will make money?
    * [ ] Risk: Are you sure you won't code for nothing for 2 years?
    * [ ] Finance Request: How much cash/help would you need to make your code reach the users?
    * [ ] In Hackathon
      * [ ] Craziness: Is the project at least a bit fun and unique in the tech?
      * [ ] Project State: Did you code a bit to prove that it could work?
* Team works: (Just for me to coach)
  * [ ] Who is in charge of the viability thinking ?
  * [ ] Who is in charge of coding ?
  * [ ] Who is in charge of be in time for the presentation ?
